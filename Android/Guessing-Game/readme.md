## Android Guessing Game
- Guess a number between one and ten thousand.
- By using a "binary search," you should be able to quickly guess the number. If you go over the amount that should be required ( log(2)MAX_NUMBER ), you lose. If you guess the number correctly, you win.
- In preferences, you are able to change the amount of numbers you guess in, as well as toggle unlimitted tries.
